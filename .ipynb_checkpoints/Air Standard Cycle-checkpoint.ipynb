    "\n",
    "   The  working principle of a 4stroke petrol engine is based on theoretical Otto cycle. Hence it is called as Otto cycle engine. The four strokes include suction stroke, compression stroke, expansion stroke or power stroke and exhaust stroke. Each stroke is completed by the rotation of crankshaft by 180°.Hence in 4stroke engines, four different strokes are completed through 2 revolutions of the crankshaft. It is easy to analyze the process taking place inside the engine with the help of P-V diagram . P-V diagram represents the plot of pressure bs volume for different conditions or strokes. So to generate a P-V diagram, we require different values of pressures and volumes. During the suction stroke the pressure inside the cylinder remains constant . At the end of suction stroke the volume occupied by the gas is nothing but the total volume of the cylinder . That is, sum of swept volume and the clearance volume. The swept volume and clearance volume  are calculated by the formula as given above.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The pressure inside the cylinder in this condition is the atmospheric pressure . At the beginning of the program necessary modules are imported. The variables for different parameters such as cylinder radius, stroke, bore, compression ratio are declared and assigned with proper values. The lists for compression pressures, expansion pressures are declared. The volume of cylinder during the compression or expansion can be computed using the formula . So, a function is created for generating different values for volumes based on the crank angle, which can be then returned to the main function .The volume_expansion and volume_compression lists hold the values of volumes generated by the called function. The compression stroke and expansion stroke represent the isentropic process. The variables of pressure, volume, temperature at the end of suction stroke are assigned with the initial conditions. At the state 2 , i. e during compression stroke the pressure of the cylinder increases which can be calculated using for loop using formula for different values of volumes .When the ignition is done the  pressure increases but the volume remains constant. So the volume occupied is nothing but the clearance volume. The temperature at this point will be about 1200K  . The increased in the pressure lead to the expansion stroke during which the volume increases but the pressure decreases. The pressure can be calculated using formula as we calculated for compression process. At the end of the expansion stroke the  volume, temperature, pressure are calculated using the formula. When one complete cycle is over  the Pressure vs Volume plot is created using plot function of matplotlib.pyplot module.\n",

    "#### Conclusion:-\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A good analyzation of working of petrol engine can be done with the help of this P-V diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The unknown pressure or temperature can found using the plot.\n"
